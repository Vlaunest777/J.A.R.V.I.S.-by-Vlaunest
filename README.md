`Jarvis` - is a voice assistant made as an experiment using neural networks for things like **STT/TTS/Wake Word/NLU** etc.

The main project challenges we try to achieve is:
 - 100% offline *(no cloud)*
 - Open source *(full transparency)*
 - No data collection *(we respect your privacy)*


*Other libraries, tools and packages can be found in source code.*

## Neural Networks

- Chat
	- [~~ChatGPT~~](https://chat.openai.com/) (coming soon)

## Supported Languages

Currently, only Russian language is supported.<br>
But soon, Ukranian and English will be added for the interface, wake-word detection and speech recognition.

## How to build?

Nothing special was used to build this project.<br>
You need only Rust and NodeJS installed on your system.<br>
Other than that, all you need is to install all the dependencies and then compile the code with `cargo tauri build` command.<br>
Or run dev with `cargo tauri dev`.
